## Algorithms

 ### December 1 - Elegant facelift
 
   #### Problem Statement
   - There is a collection of necklaces where each necklace has various stones embedded in it. Each type of stone is designated by a lowercase letter in the range ascii `[a-z]`.
   - There may be multiple occurrences of a stone in a necklace. A stone is called a `facelift` if it occurs at least once in each of the necklaces in the collection.
   - Given a list of stones embedded in each of the necklaces, display the number of types of `facelift`'s in the collection.

   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
      Input: arr = ['abcdde', 'baccd', 'eeabg']             
      Output: 2           
   ```
   ```
      Input: arr = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', ‘jkl’]                    
      Output: 0
   ```  
   #### Explanation   
   - In sample input 1, only `a` and `b` occur in every necklace. Therefore, the output is `2`.
   - In sample input 2, there are no characters repeating in the list. Therefore, the output is `0`.

### December 4 - Sandhya and her Tic-Tac-Toe love
  
  #### Problem Statement
  - Sandhya likes to play tic-tac-toe (using `2x2` matrix), and uses the elements `0`and `1`. She is wondering how many matrices with `X` rows and `Y` columns there are. Everyone obviously knows that - it is just `2X⋅Y`. But what no one knows is that, she considers two identical matrices if and only if by permuting the `X` no.of rows and then permuting the `Y` no.of columns, and the resulting matrix is transverse of itself. 
  - Help Sandhya by finding the number of `X×Y` matrices which are distinct according to her definition (even though she doesn't know how to solve them). Since the answer can/may be quite large, compute it modulo 10^9+7.
       
   <p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oriNKQe0D6uQVjcIM/giphy.gif" /></p>
  
  #### Sample Input/Output
  ```
  Input: 1 5
  Output: 6
  ```
  ```
   Input: 10 10
   Output: 508361223
  ``` 
  
   #### Explaination
   ```
   According to Sandhya's definition, there are 6 different binary matrices. 
   This is because the number of 1-s uniquely identifies a 1×5 matrix and 
   the number of 1-s can take any value between 0 and 5 inclusive.
   ```

### December 5 - Biscuit Bonanza
 
   #### Problem Statement
   - A local biscuit store sells only `2` types of biscuits: circular and rectangular biscuits. They are referred to by the numbers `0` and `1` respectively. The customers stand in a queue and they either purchase circular or rectangular biscuits. 
   - The number of biscuits is equal to the number of customers. They are placed in a stack. 
   - At each step: If the customer at the front of the queue prefers the biscuit on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
   - Otherwise, they will directly go to the queue's end.
   -  Consider two integer arrays `customers` and `biscuits` where `biscuits[i]` is the type of the `i`th biscuit in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and `customers[j]` is the preference of the `j`th customer in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). This continues until none want to take the top biscuit and are thus unable to eat.
   -  Return the number of customers that are unable to eat.

   <p align="center"><img src ="https://media.giphy.com/media/nAErqE3k2C3fy/giphy.gif" /></p>                  
   
   ### Sample Input and output
   ```
   customers = [1,1,1,0,1]
   biscuits = [1,0,0,0,1,1]
   
   Customers that are unable to eat = 3
   ```
   ```
   customers = [1,1,0,0]
   biscuits = [0,1,0,1]
   
   Customers that are unable to eat = 0
   ```   
   ```
   customers = [1,1,0,0,1,0]
   biscuits = [0,1,0,1,1,1]
   
   Customers that are unable to eat = 1
   ```   
   ### Explanation
   ```
   Input: customers = [1,1,0,0], biscuits = [0,1,0,1]
   Output: 0 
   - Front customer leaves the top biscuit and returns to the end of the line making customers = [1,0,0,1].
   - Front customer leaves the top biscuit and returns to the end of the line making customers = [0,0,1,1].
   - Front customer takes the top biscuit and leaves the line making customers = [0,1,1] and biscuits = [1,0,1].
   - Front customer leaves the top biscuit and returns to the end of the line making customers = [1,1,0].
   - Front customer takes the top biscuit and leaves the line making customers = [1,0] and biscuits = [0,1].
   - Front customer leaves the top biscuit and returns to the end of the line making customers = [0,1].
   - Front customer takes the top biscuit and leaves the line making customers = [1] and biscuits = [1].
   - Front customer takes the top biscuit and leaves the line making customers = [] and biscuits = [].
   Hence all customers are able to eat.

### December 6 - Save The Templars

### Problem Statement
  - The conflict continues. The Templar Assasins `T` and the Undying `U` are fighting to the death, but the bad is prevailing over the good. The Templars must band together in order to combat the Undying.
- At the top of the Undying Resource tower, everyone is initially arranged in a circular path.
- The Templar Assassin at index 1 is in front of the Templar Assassin at index 2 and stands close to the Templar Assassin at index `n`.
- The Templars must band together in order to win the battle.
- The Templars have a particular ability that allows them to switch bodies with anyone.
- Assist the Templars in determining the least number of swaps required so that they can all stand together.
- Given the sequence of Templar Assasins `T` and the Undying `U`, return the minimal number of swaps required. 

<p align="center"><img src ="/src/assets/templars.gif" /></p>

#### Sample Input and Output
 ```
 Input: UUTUTUT
 Output: 1
 ```
 ```
 Input: UTUTTU
 Output: 1  
 ```
 ### Explanation
 ```
 To get all U and T together in the sample test case, first replace the T at index 3 with U at index 6.
 Second, we can combine all U and T by swapping U at index 3 with T at index 2.
 ```

### December 7 - Amy helps Pawnee!

 #### Problem Statement
 - Amy Santiago is a pilot and she went to Pawnee for official work. She noticed that the city had a food shortage due to the devastating impact of COVID-19. So, she decided to help the people who are in desperate need of food by supplying them on their building with the help of her private jet-plane. 
 - All the buildings are represented by three pairs of points: `(a1, b1), (a2,b2) and (a3,b3).`
 - The jet can fly in a direction either parallel to the `x` axis or the `y` axis. It drops the food packets on every building Amy flies over in her flight. 
 - The food packet will be wasted if it is dropped on the boundary of the building as it will fall down. No two buildings touch each other. Figure out the number of buildings that receive the food packets on each flight. 
 -  A single line integer i.e the number of buildings that received the food packets on their roofs on each flight.  
 
<p align="center"><img src ="https://media.giphy.com/media/8PKXkHuRl5ht8BvXrO/giphy.gif" /></p> 

#### Sample Input and Output
 ``` 
 Number of Buildings: 3
 Coordinates of the buildings:
 1 0 0 2 2 2
 1 3 3 5 4 0 
 5 4 4 5 4 4

### December 8 - Anomalous Counter

   #### Problem Statement
   - You found a rather bizarre counter around your area. You see that there are two dials, one is the cycle dial and another is the counter value dial. 
   - When you start the counter, you see in the counter dial that it starts with the initial value 3 and then you see the counter value decreases by 1 each second until the value becomes 1.
   - In the next second you see that the cycle dialer is incremented to 1 and the counter value becomes twice the initial value of the counter in the previous cycle.
   - You decided to invite your friends to play a guessing game, i.e to find the value displayed by the counter at a particular time(in seconds). 


   <p align="center"><img src ="/src/assets/counter.png" /></p>                  

   ### Sample Input and output
   ```
   Input: time = 22   
   Output: counter value = 24
   ```
   ```
   Input: time = 0
   Output: counter value = 0
   ```

   ### Explanation
   ```
   Input: time = 22
   Output: 24
   
   time=22 marks the beginning of the fourth cycle. 
   So the counter value is double the number displayed at the beginning of the third cycle(when time=10): 12X2 = 24.
   This is shown in the diagram in the problem statement.
   ```

### December 9 - Dream 11

   #### Problem Statement
    - As a Cricket coach, you have to pick `P` understudies to address your school. There are `N` understudies. 
    - The aptitude rating of `N` understudies has been given as input, which is a positive number indicating how gifted they are. Right away, it likely will not be possible to pick a sensible gathering, so you will give a piece of the understudies one-on-one educating. 
    - It requires one hour of preparing to extend the ability rating of any understudy by 1. The resistance season is starting very soon, so you'd like to notice the base number of extensive stretches of guidance you need to give before you can pick a sensible gathering.
    - Output the base number of long periods of instruction required, before you can pick a reasonable group of `P` understudies.

   <p align="center"><img src ="https://media.giphy.com/media/kBf6l8fkDWiWfDhdNu/giphy.gif" height = "300"/></p> 
 
   ### Sample Input and output

   ```
   N = 4, P =3   
   N = [3, 1, 9, 100]
   
   Base number of periods required = 14
   ```
   ```
   N = 6, P = 2
   N = [5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
   
   Base number of periods required = 0
   ```
   ```
   N = 5, P = 5
   N = [7, 7, 1, 7, 7]
   
   Base number of periods required = 6
   ```

### December 10 - Juicy Orange Field

   #### Problem Statement
   - You are in a field of juicy oranges that is like a grid of size `n x n`. You plan to collect most of the oranges in the field before the storm comes. Each cell can be any one of the following:
        - A cell can be empty (represented by 0), so you can pass through the cell.
        - A cell that contains the orange trees where you can pick up the oranges and pass through to the next cell. (represented by 1)
        - A cell covered with prickles and thorns that blocks your way to the next cell (represented by -1).
   - As it’s a big field you have to follow certain rules to find the maximum number of oranges you can collect before the storm hits:-
        - You begin at the first cell and you have to reach the last cell by moving right or down through valid cells (cells that do not contain prickles and thorns).
        - After reaching the last cell, you have to return to the first cell by moving left or up through valid cells.
        - When passing through a cell containing oranges, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell.
        - If there is no valid path between the first and last cell, then no oranges can be collected.
  
   <p align="center"><img src ="/src/assets/orangefield.gif" height = "300"/></p> 
 
   ### Sample Input and output

   ```
   Input: field = [[0,1,-1],[1,0,-1],[1,1,1]]
   Output: 5
   ```
  
  ### Explanation
   ```
   Input: field = [[0,1,-1],[1,0,-1],[1,1,1]]
   Output: 5
   
   You started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
   4 oranges were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
   Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more orange.
   The total number of oranges picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.
   ```

### December 11 - Maze Festival

   #### Problem Statement
   - On the occasion of Halloween, a grand corn maze puzzle has been set up in the fields of **Hubb’s farm, New York**. There are several mystery boxes hidden at each magic spot. 
   - Assume that there are `N` magic spots from `1` to `N` in the entire field.
   - Given the points to the spots `P` and `Q` and the distance between them `D` and also a participant who choses the starting spot `A`, the path chosen to reach the final spot `B` and the final magic spot `C`.
   - Identify whether the participant can reach the destination spot or not.   
   - If yes print the minimum distance(shortest path) covered and the path taken by the participant to reach the final magic spot. Else print **"NO PATH FOUND”**.
  
   - Note: If a pathway connects `A` to `B` with distance `D` then it means that it will connect from `B` to `A` with the same distance `D`.

### December 12 - Ford vs Ferrari

  ### Problem Statement
  - Two friends Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles are playing a game where they arrange all the toy cars in a row and run them in random directions. 
  - Each car has a certain superiority level associated with it and both max and sergio are aware of the superiority levels. They want to know the state of cars once they move       them.
  - We are given an array `cars` of integers representing cars in a row. For each car, the absolute value represents its superiority, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). 
  - Each car moves at the same speed. Find out the state of the cars after all collisions. 
  - If two cars meet, the less superior one will break. If both are of the same superiority, both will break. Two cars moving in the same direction will never meet.
     <p align="center"><img src ="https://media1.giphy.com/media/mNT2zQTgAEY5q/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e4743w1a4914iot1yt8hkqfk8cvsosad4uhxe4uzgtz&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g" height =             "300"/></p> 
  
  ### Sample Input and Output
  
   ```
   Input: cars = [4,8,-2]
   Output: [4,8]
   ```
   ```
   Input: cars = [5,-5]
   Output: []    
   ```
   ```
   Input: cars = [10,2,-5]
   Output: [10]    
   ``` 
    
  ### Explanation
   ```
    Input: cars = [4,8,-2]
    Output: [4,8]
    
    - The car with superiority level 8 and -2 collide resulting in car with superiority level 8. 
    - The cars 4 and 8 never collide because they are moving in the same direction.        
    - Therefore, the ouptut is [4,8]

   ### Sample Input/Output
   
   ```
     Input:
     z = 3, x = 3
     k₀ = 5, r₀ = 110
     k₁ = 9, r₁ = 500
     k₂ = 20, r₂ = 400
     m₀ = 10, n₀ = 100
     m₁ = 2, n₁ = 200
     m₂ = 30, n₂ = 300
     
     Output: Maximum number of diamonds sold = 2
   ```
   ```
     Input:
     z = 2, x = 2
     k₀ = 3, r₀ = 100
     k₁ = 5, r₁ = 150
     m₀ = 4, n₀ = 145
     m₁ = 2, n₁ = 80
     
     Output: Maximum number of diamonds sold = 2
   ```
  ### Explanation
  ```
   In case 1:
     - Client 0 will be interested in diamond 0 because it has more than k₀ = 5 units of purity and costs less than r₀ = 110 . 
     - Both of the other diamonds are outside of this client's price range.
     - Client 1 will be interested in diamonds 0 and 2 , as both these diamonds have more than k₁ = 9 units of purity and cost less than r₁ = 500 .
     - They will not be interested in the remaining diamonds because it's less pure.
     - Client 2 will be interested in diamond 2 because it has more than k₂ = 20  units of purity and costs less than r₂ = 400 . 
     - They will not be interested in the other two diamonds because they are less pure.
     - All three clients are interested in the same two houses, so you can sell at most two houses in the following scenarios:
     - Client 0 buys diamond 0 and client 1 buys diamond 2.
     - Client 1 buys diamond 0 and client 2 buys diamond 2.
     - Client 0 buys diamond 0 and client 2 buys diamond 2 .
     - Thus, we print the maximum number of diamond you can sell, 2, on a new line.            
   ```

### December 16 - Catch Me If You Can 
 
   #### Problem Statement 
   - Leo is a lion that escaped from the zoo, and `X` forest rangers are up for catching him. 
   - The rangers want to catch Leo no matter the cost, and Leo also wants to eliminate as many rangers as possible (preferably everyone) before getting caught (or before running      away after eliminating everyone). Neither the rangers nor Leo will run away before accomplishing their goals.
   - Leo and the officers are on a one-dimensional grid with coordinates ranging from `−10¹º to 10¹º`. Leo is initially standing at coordinate `A`, and the `i`th ranger is initially at coordinate `Ci`. The rangers and Leo then take turns to move, with the ranger team moving first.
   - During their turn, rangers will have to move to an adjacent unoccupied cell one by one, in any order they want. Every ranger will have to move. At every moment of time, no      two rangers can be in the same cell, and also no ranger can be in the same cell as Leo. 
   - If the ranger is unable to move to an adjacent unoccupied cell, he is eliminated (and the cell he was in becomes unoccupied). Note that the ranger team will try to move to      eliminate as few rangers as possible. 
   - After the ranger team's turn, Leo also moves to an adjacent unoccupied cell, or gets caught if he cannot find any adjacent unoccupied cell. 
   - The process then repeats until either Leo is caught, or all rangers are eliminated and Leo runs away.
   - You need to find out the maximum number of rangers that can be eliminated by Leo, and if Leo can run away or not.

  #### Sample Input/Output
     
  ```
  Input:
   T = 1, X = 2, A = 2
   (C1 C2) = 1 4
   
  Output:
   1 -1
  ```
  ```
  Input:
   T = 1, X = 1, A=2    
   (C1 C2) = 1 
   
  Ouput:
   1  1    
  ```
     
  #### Explanation
      
   ```
   For test case 1:
      - Leo chooses to always move to the left (i.e. to the smaller coordinate); this forces the ranger at coordinate 1 to always move to the left, and eventually being 
        cornered and eliminated.
      - However, the officer at coordinate 4 cannot be eliminated, and hence Chef will be caught at the end.
        For test case 2:
        Similarly, Leo chooses to always move to the left, and eventually eliminating the only ranger, thus running away at the end.       
   ```

   ### December 17 - The Bossy Manager
  
  #### Problem Statement
  - Ram is an assistant manager in the bank. His boss, is very bossy and assigns him to tasks and asks him to complete them as soon as possible. 
  - This manager also has some parameters which are assigned to each and every task which he has to note. They are:
    - The maximum number of tasks he can complete in a single go
    - The time taken to complete the single task for that job
    - The number of tasks each job can process
  - And at last the manager asks Ram to calculate the minimum time needed to process a set of tasks for the given job. Ram did a course on data structures and using his knowledge on this subject he plans to complete this task in less time. Try helping Ram out and see if he can outwit his manager!

   <p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YwpylUojkfOZa/giphy.gif" /></p>    
    
#### Sample Input/Output:
  ```
  Input:  
  Task size = [3,2,5,7]
  Processing time = [5,4,10,12]  
  Number of tasks = [10,6,10,5]

  Output: The minimum time to process all the tasks is 20.
  ``` 
  ```
  Input: 
  Task size = [4,3]
  Processing time = [6,5]
  Number of tasks = [8,8]
  
  Output: The minimum time to process all the tasks is 15.
  ```
#### Explanation:
  ```  
  Task size = [4,3]
  Processing time = [6,5]
  Number of tasks = [8,8]

  Queue 0 can process a maximum of 4 tasks in 6 minutes, and queue is 1 can process a maximum of 3 tasks in 5 minutes. Each queue has 8 tasks to process. The time required to perform the assigned tasks in the minimum possible time is calculated as follows:

  For queue 0:
  - At time = 0, a new batch of 4 tasks is initiated 
  - At time= 6, the first batch of tasks is processed and a new batch of 4 tasks is initiated.
  - At time = 12, the second batch of tasks is processed. There are no more tasks left to process in this queue.

  For queue 1:  
  - At time = 0, a new batch of 3 tasks is initiated.
  - At time= 5, the first batch of tasks is processed and a new batch of 3 tasks is initiated.
  - At time = 15, the third batch of tasks is processed. There are no more tasks left to process in this queue.
  The minimum time to process all the tasks is 15.

### December 19 - Winter is coming

#### Problem Statement
- Winter semester is about to begin. The previous semester’s professors had already instructed the students that it is mandatory to take up a value added course in order to take up a subject course. There are a total of `num` courses to be taken and they are labelled from `0` to `num-1`. Consider the array `course` where 
`course[i] = [ai, bi]`. 
- It is mandatory for a student to take up the value added course `ai` in order to take up the subject course `bi`.

Eg : the pair `[3,8]` says that one must take up the value added course `3` in order to take up the subject course `8`. 

- These mandatory courses can be indirect as well. Suppose, course `p` is mandatory to take up course `q` and course `q` is mandatory to take up course `r`. Then, course `p`   is mandatory in order to take up course `r`.  
- Consider another array `answer` where `answer[x] = [mx, nx]`. You must answer if course `mx` is mandatory in order to take up course `nx` or not for the `xth` query. 
- Return a boolean array `result`, where `result[x]` is the answer to the `xth` query.

#### Sample Input and Output

```
Input: num = 2, course = [[1,0]], answer = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [false,true]
```
```
Input: num = 3, course = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], answer = [[1,0],[1,2]]
Output: [true,true]
```
```
Input: num = 2, course = [], answer = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: [false,false]
```
#### Explanation 
```
Input: num = 2, course = [[1,0]], answer = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The pair [1, 0] indicates that you have to take the value added course 1 before you can take the subject course 0. 
Course 0 is not mandatory to take up course 1, but the opposite is true.

### December 20 - High Traffic Server(s)
 
   #### Problem Statement
   In your company there are `n` servers, numbered `0` to `n-1`, that are handling numerous requests at the same time. Each server has limitless processing power, but it can only handle one request at a time. The requests are routed to servers using the following algorithm:
   - The `k`th request arrives. That `k`th request is discarded if all servers are busy (not handled at all).
   - Assign the request to the `(k % n)`th server if it’s available.
   - Otherwise, forward the request to the next server that is accessible. If the kth server is busy, for example, try routing the request to the `(k+1)`th server, then the `(k+2)`th server, and so on.
  
   You are given the arrival time of the requests and the load time(time taken to complete the request by the server). Your objective is to **find the server which handles the most number of requests**.    
   
   <p align="center"><img src ="https://media4.giphy.com/media/XsHkc4MCBXDn0yNybG/giphy.gif" width="320" height ="300"/></p> 
      
  #### Sample Input and output

   ```
   Input: n = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
   Output: [1] 
   ```   
   ```
   Input: n = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
   Output: [0]
   ```   
   ```
  Input: n = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]
  Output: [0,1,2]
   ```
  #### Explanation
   ```
   Input: n = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
   Output: [0]
   
   The first three requests are processed by the first three servers.
   The third request has arrived. Because the server is accessible, it is handled by server 0.
   Server 0 dealt with two requests, whereas servers 1 and 2 each dealt with one. As a result, server 0 is the busiest.
   ```

### December 22 - Richie Rich
 
   #### Problem Statement

   - Christian is a world renowned entrepreneur who has a lot of craze for maths. In order to exhibit his love for maths he decided to buy a land and design it in the form of an undirected simple graph with `X` vertices (numbered 1 through `X`) and `Y` edges (numbered 1 through `Y`). 
   - For each valid `p`, the `p`th edge connects vertices `mₚ` and `nₚ`. Christian wants to show off his car and bike collection on the field and therefore wants to place his bikes and cars on the edges so that the graph would be perfectly balanced, which means that for each vertex, the number of bikes edges incident to it must be equal to the number of cars edges incident to it.
   - Obviously, Christian does not want to leave any edges blank, but he immediately realised that in such a case, it generally may be impossible to make the graph perfectly balanced, so instead he decided to display his helicopter collection on some of the edges, so that it is always possible to balance the graph.
   - Since helicopters are the most expensive, Christian’s satisfaction with the graph will be greater when he uses fewer edges to display his helicopter collection.
   - Can you help him choose what he has to display(bike,car or helicopter) on the edges so that he can show off his love for maths and his wealth in a perfectly balanced and satisfactory manner?
   - Return an array, for each valid `p`, the `p`th of these lines should contain the integer `0` if you want the `i`th edge to be a helicopter, `1` if you want it to be a bike or `−1` if you want it to be a car.   
      
  #### Sample Input and output
   
   ```
   Input: X = 5, Y = 6
          [mₚ, nₚ] = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 3]]
   Output: [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1]
   ```
   ```
   Input: X = 6, Y = 9
          [mₚ, nₚ] = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4], [3, 6], [4, 5], [5, 6]]  
   Output: [-1, 1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0]
   ```
  #### Explanation
   <p align="center"><img src ="/src/assets/helicopterGraph.png"/></p> 
   
   ```
   The graph can be perfectly balanced without using any helicopters on the edges.
   Green colour - car on the edges.
   Red colour - bike on the edges.
   Thus, without using any helicopters on the edges the graph is perfectly balanced in this case.
   ```

  ### December 23 - Ant Got Track
 
   #### Problem Statement

   - The National Ant Marathon Committee has decided to conduct this year’s marathon. The committee has to decide the route that is cyclic and consists of 4 different roads.
   - Their city has `X` intersections and `Y` bidirectional roads.They want to hold it in all places throughout the city and make sure they cover a new route every day.
   - Two routes are said to be equal if their sets of component roads are equal.
   - You need to determine the maximum number of days the marathon needs to be held such that every route travelled is different.
   - Two arrays `A` and `B` which define a bidirectional road connecting intersections `Ai` and `Bi`. 
      
  <p align="center"><img src="https://c.tenor.com/gkfAjgzEulcAAAAC/ant-ants.gif" /></p>  
   
   #### Sample Input/Output
   ```
   Input: X = 4, Y = 6
             A  B
             1  2
             2  3
             3  4
             4  1
             1  3
             2  4

   Output: 3
   ```
   ```
   Input: X = 3, Y = 4
             A  B
             1  2
             3  2
             1  3
             2  1

   Output: 2
   ```
   #### Explanation
   ```
   In case 1: There are 3 different cyclic routes that can be taken for the marathon.

    1->2->3->4->1
    1->3->2->4->1
    1->2->4->3->1

    Recall that each route is a set of intersections forming a cycle, so each unique route is the same regardless of which city on the route the ants start out at. Thus, we print 3 (the number of routes) as our answer.
   ```

FAQ
======

#### Who can join the Challenge?
Anyone who is passionate about coding and can dedicate a little time a day for the challenge for the next 31 days.

#### When should I submit the pull request?
You don't need to submit it everyday. Just submit it once you're done with all 31 algorithms.

#### What if I'm not able to code every day?
Not a problem. While coding every day is nice, we understand that other commitments might interfere with it. Plus its holiday season. So you don't have to solve one problem every day. Go at your own pace. One per day or 7 a week or even all 30 in a day.

#### What language should I use to code?
Anything! New to GoLang? Best way to practice it. Wanna find out what all this hype about Python is? Use it! Any and all languages are welcomed. Maybe you could try using a different language for every problem as a mini-challenge?

#### Fork? Pull request? What is all that? I don't know how to use GitHub!
If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out this out [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

#### Where are the rest of the problems?
Our code ninjas are hard at work preparing the rest of the problems. Don't worry, they'll be up soon.

#### How should I complete these programs?
We have a folder for each day of the month. Simply complete your code and move the file into that folder. Be sure to rename your file to the following format: `language_username` or `language_username_problemname`
Some examples:
`python3_exampleUser.py`
`c_exampleUser.c`
**Please do not modify any existing files in the repository.**

#### I forked the repository but some problems were added only after that. How do I access those problems?
Not to worry! Open your nearest terminal or command prompt and navigate over to your forked repository. Enter these commands:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2021.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
If you're curious, the commands simply add a new remote called upstream that is linked to this repository. Then it 'fetches' or retrieves the contents of the repository and attempts to merge it with your progress.
Note that if you've already added the upstream repository, you don't need to re-add it in the future while fetching the newer questions.

#### I received a merge error. What do I do?
This shouldn't happen unless you modify an existing file in the repository. There's a lot of potential troubleshooting that might be needed, but the simplest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Now repeat the steps from the answer above. Merge it and then add your code. Now proceed as usual. :)

#### I'm facing difficulties with/need help understanding a particular question.
Open up an [issue](https://github.com/SVCE-ACM/A-December-of-Algorithms-2021/issues) on this repository and we'll do our best to help you out.
